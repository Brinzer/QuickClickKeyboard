Hello!

In a quick survey I did in the Muscular Dystrophy community, over 70% of computer users use a mouse and on-screen keyboard, yet so much 
interaction is done through hover functionality and hotkeys. There are minimal tools and web accessibility practices out there to make 
computer usage fully accessible to mouse/touchpad/trackball users. These limitations become even more apparent with specialized software, 
such as CAD and video editing applications. Would anyone like to help me build something to accommodate this group, of which I am a part?

This app I'm trying to have built is a more advanced on-screen keyboard than the ones integrated into Windows and mobile operating systems. 
It would allow people who can't use physical keyboards [mouse, touchpad, or trackball only] to not feel limited by hotkeys and hover 
interactivity by making it possible to replicate these using only a pointing device.

If you would like to see my idea:

Fill out this survey on it:

And look at my open-to-add-to list [that the disability community has been contributing to] of all the challenges people face when using a 
computer without a physical keyboard:

Please share any thoughts and thanks so much for helping!

All the best!
